I've solved the challenges in C++, each solution is a .cpp file.
Every folder has the title structured as dXX, XX being the ID of the day :  01,02,...,25
In each folder, the solutions are titled as :
- dXX (contains both parts of the day problem) 
- dXXpYY (where YY is the ID of the problem's part, either 01 - first half of the problem - , or 02 - the second half )   
- or dXX_final, where I had to update the solution several times for reasons such as time efficiency, readability, etc. I've moved the old files in separate subfolders.
