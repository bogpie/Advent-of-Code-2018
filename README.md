I've solved the challenges in C++, each solution is a .cpp file.
Every folder has the title structured as dXX, XX being the ID of the day :  01,02,...,25

In each folder, the solutions are titled as :
- dXX (contains both parts of the problem for that day) 
- dXXpYY (where YY is the ID of the problem's part, either 01 - first half of the problem - , or 02 - the second half )   
- or dXX_final, where I had to update the solution several times for reasons such as time efficiency, readability, etc. I've moved the old files in separate subfolders.

The inputs and outputs are .in and .out files mentioned in the code.
